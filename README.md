## Project Description: Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript Game

In this project, I have developed a classic Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows users to play against the computer, making their choices between Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The game mechanics are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

The user interface provides a visually appealing and interactive experience, displaying the user's choice and the computer's random selection. After making their choice, the game determines the winner and displays the result, along with the updated scores. The user can continue playing rounds until they decide to stop.

This JavaScript game project serves as a fun and engaging way to practice fundamental programming concepts, including event handling, conditional statements, and random number generation. Players can challenge themselves or compete with friends to see who can achieve the highest score in this exciting game of Rock Paper Scissors.
